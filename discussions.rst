Discussion Summaries
====================

:download:`Benchmarking <docs/HPCWorkshop-Benchmarking.pdf>`
------------------------------------------------------------

Extended Summary
................

General appetite for more information on how to benchmark and profile and what tools
are available to help?
  Very useful for RSEs and beyond working on HPC

Benchmark reproducibility and how to measure, how to set it up? Techniques and
strategies

What should be in a common repository?
  How do you moderate content?
  How do you maintain/update benchmarks?
  What should be included, e.g. ML
  What is a fair comparison
Scope for pulling together a UK benchmarking interest group

Potential impact:
  Procurement, unified/verifiable acceptance approach across sector
  Beneficial for purchasers and vendors
  Ops longitudinal performance/impact of upgrades
  Advising and helping users to use resources efficiently
    Which resource to use?
    How to use it, e.g. scaling, internal paramaeterisation

Licensing:
  Material included must be free of license conditions, e.g. inputs for some codes fall under license.
  Performance data must be openly available free of NDA

:download:`Community <docs/HPCWorkshop-Community.pdf>`
------------------------------------------------------

Extended Summary
................

Concluded that we want to continue to grow the community
Ensure it is not just an annual event and folk who cannot attend events are also included


:download:`Engagement <docs/HPCWorkshop-Engagement.pdf>`
--------------------------------------------------------

Extended Summary
................

Diverse ways on how we get / increase engagements
- Good to compare notes / approaches between sites
Q: How do we find the users who aren't engaged with
HPC?
Issues:
Academics are pressed for time
Some departments/users/groups are more accessible that
others
Users not aware of potential value, code works means it's ok
Possible Solutions:
Training,
Coffee mornings,
Advertising on screens - sometimes an option,
Awareness of who's available,
Liaising with CDT
2 days of training is good, fast is good
How to engage HPC users?
Driving tests, periodic account expiry
Continued training
Symposiums (e.g. Bath)
  
:download:`Impact <docs/HPCWorkshop-Impact.pdf>` 
------------------------------------------------

Extended Summary
................

New positions - we get flexibility but little guidance on what success means.
RSE role/collaborators/projects can be so varied that no one size fits all.
In the design of metrics, who are we trying to convince?
Ideas:
  Publications
  Talks
  Workshop organisation
  Customer statements
  Training
  Quantification of benefits inc staff effort
  Funding proposals

:download:`Training <docs/HPCWorkshop-Training.pdf>`
----------------------------------------------------

Extended Summary
................

Yes. Support as much (good) training as possible.
There is a distinction to be made between training to introduce you to a specific resource (eg
Tier 3) and general skills courses like HPC carpentry - how to create roadmap?
HPC Champions should contribute to and publicise good training materials (e.g. HPC
Carpentry) & help with obtaining funding to hold training sessions?
It’s tough to train with site-specific information in such a way that you make it clear what
*isn’t* site-specific -- this is especially important if people come from other institutions to
shared training -- which is something that would be ideal if HPC Carpentry training sessions
became common.
More modular training better - 4-5-day courses on e.g. all of Unix, Python, Git, HPC,
OpenMP, MPI will be exhausting for the learner.
But then you have challenges around prerequisites.
