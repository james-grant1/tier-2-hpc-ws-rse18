After Thoughts
==============

HPC Champions is wanted and discussion at the following HPC-SIG 24th September 2018 showed considerable alignment on concerns, needs for the future.

Perhaps not surprising as a number of HPC-SIG are/were (Archer) Champions and a number of attendees at this workshop attended the meeting.

Champions could easily support a number of themes/chapters such as those highlighted by the discussion groups topics.

Almost absurdly the word cloud was not mentioned once during general discussionat the worksop.  This anomaly possibly arising from a degree of overload at the conference 'proper' should be recognised and a chapter on cloud/role of cloud in HPC considered in the mix.

Many thanks for all who attended and contributed to the day.  

Please feel free to fork and pull request to add comments raise issues not addressed in the notes.
