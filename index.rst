Welcome to the Tier-2/Regional HPC Workshop!
==============================================

The workshop aims to bring together RSEs working in the HPC space to discuss how we can build on the success of `Archer Champions <http://www.archer.ac.uk/community/champions/>`_.
The recent EPSRC investment in Tier-2 HPC machines supported by Universities creating RSE positions to port, optimise and develop codes has provided a great opportunity for our community.   With DiRAC and further regional initiatives such as N8-RSE, Supercomputing Wales there has been a sea change in the number of centrally funded roles building on the EPCC and established university groups.  However if this momentum is to be maintained and the benefit of this investment is to be realised we need to work together to demonstrate our value.  It is easy to become siloed working in our institutions and this workshop is an opportunity to find out what others centres are doing and how we can collaborate in training and supporting researchers.
