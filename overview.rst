Overview
========

The aim of the workshop is to bring together RSEs, principally from Tier-2 and Regional HPC centres, to dicuss how we can contribute to Archer/HPC Champions and in doing so demonstrate the value we can deliver, supporting and training researchers in our centres and using the facilities at our centres.

The day will split either side of lunch with the morning consisting of a series of talks of general interest to RSEs covering development and porting as well as talks centred around Isambard, the GW4 Tier-2 HPC and Supercomputing Wales.
The afternoon will begin with an introduction to Archer/HPC Champions followed by discussion and then breaking out into a group discussions on suggested topics.

Our thanks go to Debbie Carter and Andrew Edmonson, University of Birmingham for arranging rooms and to Claire Wyatt, RSE Network, University of Southampton for her invaluable help organising the event. 
We also thank Arm and the UK RSE Association for sponsorship which has enabled us to provide lunch and refreshments.
